<h2 class="border">How It Plays</h2>
<p>The RPG is powered by a simple dice roll, comparing your die with the GM's Narrativium die. Whenever you do something that has a chance of failure, you'll follow these simple steps.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Justify the Action Using Traits</li>
  <li>GM Determines the Outcome Die</li>
  <li>Roll the Outcome Die Against the Narrativium Die</li>
  <li>Get Help (optional)</li>
  <li>Resolve the Test (not optional)</li>
  <li>By picking a trait from your character and using it to justify your chance of success the GM will decide which die you roll - anything from a d4 to a d12. You roll that, while your GM rolls a d7A*. If your outcome die has rolled higher than the GM's Narrativium die, you're successful! But if the Narrativium die is higher, then you've failed, and may now be subject to unforeseen consequences or twists, represented as new traits!</li>
</ul>
