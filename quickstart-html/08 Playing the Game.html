    <p>A quick note before we get into playing the game. This is a quickstart, which means that it is a stripped down ruleset designed to get your character's feet hitting those cobbles as fast as possible. As such there are some aspects of the rules that we have chosen not to include. We've provided you with pre-generated characters and an adventure to muddle through because we're considerate like that. </p>
    <p>Also worth noting is that while this is close to the final game, "there's many a slip twixt dress and drawers" as Nanny Ogg is wont to say. Some of the content here may look slightly different when the full game comes out.</p>

    <h2>Scenes</h2>
    <p>The narrative of your game can be broken down into scenes, just like the Discworld novels. Each scene is a discrete moment. It takes place at a specific place, at a specific time, with specific people present. The GM sets the scene for the players, and then narrates how the PCs’ actions affect the scene. Once players have done all they want to (or can do) in a scene, the GM moves the action onto the next scene. Scenes can span minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, decades and even aeons if you really want them to, but realistically most scenes within this book shouldn’t take more than an hour tops. </p>
    <p>Once a scene has been set players are going to want to start fiddling with it. To do this they will be using their characters (player characters, or PCs, to be precise) and dice to take actions and attempt tests. String these scenes together in a semi-coherent manner and Bjorn Stronginthearm’s your uncle! You’ve gone and got yourself a story.</p>
