  Squatting on the dark loam of the Sto Plains, surrounded by cabbage fields as far as the eye can see and bisected by the River Ankh, which can only be called a river because it moves slightly faster than the surrounding land, this ancient city has stood for thousands of years. Built and rebuilt upon itself, it has weathered invasions (by letting the invaders in, making them it's own, and robbing them blind in the process), several civil wars, and too many fires to count, owing to the time-honoured Morporkian tradition of building out of tinder dry wood and thatch waterproofed with pitch.
</p>
<p>
  The city thrives under the careful ministrations of the Patrician, Lord Vetinari. One of his most enlightened moves was encouraging the Thieves’ Guild to come out of the shadows and into the public eye, taking their place at civic banquets and in the smooth running of the city, with the reasoning that if you were going to have crime it might as well be organised crime.
</p>
<p>
  And the city does run. It shouldn’t but it does. Vetinari has managed to convince the guilds that he is slightly preferable to any other option. Since his inauguration as Patrician the city has seen many changes, including the resurgence of the Watch. Having at one point dwindled into a handful of unemployables no one in their right mind would take seriously, it is now an efficient policing force led by Commander Sir Samuel Vimes. This thin brown smear stands between the fine and upstanding citizens of Ankh-Morpork and, ah, themselves. And any unlicensed thieves, of course.*
</p>
<p>
  The Watch keeps the peace, although very few know where, and now the guilds spend slightly more time plotting against each other than they do against the Patrician. Now everything works. Mostly.

    <span class="footnote">*</span> In fact the best an unlicensed thief can hope for is to be caught by the Watch. Those caught by the Thieves’ Guild tend to experience an extremely pointed, or very blunt, version of justice, depending on whatever the Guild has to hand at the time.

  But when is now? Ankh-Morpork has a long and sordid history in which there have been infinite nows, but we’re not concerned with those old nows, we care about this present Now. Now is the turn of the Century of the Anchovy. The Century of the Fruit Bat saw many societal and technological leaps forward, or at least sideways, for the people of Ankh-Morpork. They were landed on by dragons, and saw multiple assassination attempts of important figures, not least of which were the Patrician and Sir Samuel Vimes. This year we look forward to the looming anniversary of Koom Valley (the only battle in history where both sides ambushed the other), one of the many reasons for the ancient grudge between dwarfs and trolls.
</p>
<p>
  Ankh-Morpork has grown from a place near permanently on fire to a thriving metropolis inhabited by species of all different and wonderful shapes and sizes.*
</p>
<p>
  For those familiar with the Discworld novels, this particular Now sits somewhere around the events of Going Postal and Thud!. Koom Valley looms ahead like an iceberg, the Grand Trunk Semaphore Company grinds the clacks into the ground in the name of profit, and a certain con man named by doting, if unwise, parents plies his trade with no thought of angels.

  This is the Now of <em>
    <strong>Adventures in Ankh-Morpork.</strong>

<h2>Tone</h2>
<p>
  Our aim with this game is to bring that core, indefinable Discworldyness to your tabletop. The focus here isn’t on delving into dungeons or fighting dragons.** Nor will you be moving 30 feet and dealing 12 damage to a monster. There are no rules for combat. While violence and conflict are commonplace in Ankh-Morpork, combat is never the point of the story. The focus is on the characters, the world, and the words. People are defined by traits, not numbers. The world and the players vie to control the story as Narrativium sluices finely through everything, gently pushing things towards a satisfying conclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, we encourage players to bend the English language far beyond what is usually considered reasonable. Terry Pratchett used words in ways that were unexpected, in combinations and meanings that were playful, joyful and often unreasonable. We heartily encourage you to do the same. The more awful the puns, the better.

  <h3>Safety Tools</h3>
  <p>
    A plethora of safety tools are available for budding RPG players. For those unaware or uninitiated, safety tools are tools to keep you safe at the table. A less facetious explanation is that these are ways in which everyone at the table can ensure that everyone else is having a good time. No person (player or GM) should ever feel uncomfortable or upset at the table. Characters can get uncomfortable and upset, but the people around the table should be enjoying the story, not wishing they could be somewhere else.
  </p>
  <p>
    To this end there are many more resources than we can cover here. One main method is to discuss potentially upsetting topics before the game begins and outline whether each player is okay with them being ‘on-screen’, ‘off-screen’, or not included at all. This is known as lines and veils (Ron Edwards), and more information can be found online. Another is the X card system (Jon Stavropoulos) which involves giving each player a card (or other item) to hold up when the game is straying into uncomfortable territory. If a player holds up an X card, the GM moves on from the scene without need for further discussion. Many other safety tools can be found online.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main thing to remember is; talk to each other. Have a discussion before play to make sure everyone is on the same page and if anything becomes uncomfortable stop the game. No explanation is necessary in the moment, just ask for a break or for a rewind or however your group has chosen to handle sensitive topics. You’re all people and should treat each other's boundaries with respect. Remember that these tools are there to ensure everyone is enjoying themselves.

    <span class="footnote">**</span> Swamp dragons are rather too small to offer much of a fight, for a start. Combine this with their inclination to explode if startled and you’ve got a recipe for some very disappointed, and slightly singed, adventurers milling around sheepishly picking bits of dragon out of their hair.
