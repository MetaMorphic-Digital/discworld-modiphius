<p>
  There are a few things that you’ll need in order to play a game of <strong>
    <em>Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em>
  </strong>. You should have most of them lying around, although the more specialised items (such as polyhedral dice, friends and time) may require a little more work to acquire.
</p>

<h2>Pen and Paper</h2>
<p>
  Somewhere to take notes and something to take them with. A pen and paper are traditional, but this is the Century of the Anchovy so go digital if you like.
</p>
<p>
  Whatever your preferred medium, taking notes will be useful for everyone to keep track of what's going on, who said what, and that one NPC with the silly name that the party adopted so now the GM has to keep doing That Voice for the rest of the adventure.
</p>
<h2>Dice</h2>
<p>
  A full set of polyhedral dice (A d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 and d100) for failing… erm… attempting tests. Each shorthand given refers to the number of sides the die has. So d4 means a four-sided die, d20 means a twenty-sided die, and we’re fairly sure you can figure out the rest from there, although the d100 has to be contrary and break this mold. It is in fact two d10's rolled together, one to give you the tens (10-100) and the other the ones (1-10). The d20 and d100 will only be needed for rolling on tables, however, not used in general play. As a result, you won’t need them in this book.
</p>
<p>
  Dice inject an element of randomness into your story. Things will not always go your characters' way. The Narrativium in the bones of the Disc may decide that you are simply not meant to do whatever it is you’re attempting, and you’ll have to figure out how to achieve your goal regardless.
</p>

<h2>Imagination</h2>
<p>
  RPGs require a certain amount of imagination from both players and GMs. The story will be affected by everyone at the table, and may require a little bit of imagination to get off the ground.
</p>

<h2>Punes, or Plays on Words</h2>

<p>
  No session of <strong>
    <em>Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em>
  </strong>, or Discworld book for that matter, would be complete without at least a few punes, or plays on words. Be prepared to twist, wrangle and torment the English language to serve your needs, or just to make people chuckle.
</p>

<h2>Friends</h2>
<p>
  We can’t help you with this one.* You’ll want to bring together three to six like-minded individuals willing to put up with puns, who are up for an adventure based in the historic byways and filth covered highways of Ankh-Morpork. Obviously you can play with as many players  as you like, but once you get beyond about five players, making decisions and ensuring everyone gets their time to shine becomes exponentially more difficult. Likewise, having only two players at the table limits your ability to bounce off one another and have things go in unexpected (and fun) directions.
</p>

<h2>Time</h2>
<p>
  <strong>
    <em>Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em>
  </strong> is intended to be played as a short-form storytelling game, or as a palette cleanser between long-form campaign play. The adventure in these pages should only take one session, of around three to four hours, to complete, allowing you to get the feel of the game with barely any commitment whatsoever. There will be some guidance for those that want to play longer form games but the core system is designed to be like the Discworld novels themselves; a one off adventure rather than an epic journey involving stolen jewellery and a lot of walking.

    <span class="footnote">*</span>Unless we’re counted amongst your friends, in which case, hi, how are you? It’s been too long, I know, we should organise a catch-up at some point. Next week? No…no, we’re busy next week, but could you do the 25th? No? Well we’ll message about it and sort something out, promise.
