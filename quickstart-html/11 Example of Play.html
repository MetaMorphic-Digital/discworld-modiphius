    <p>The party has made their way into the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons. After a brief description Raphael, playing Cliff, talks with Rosie Devant-Molei and discovers that while she is more than willing to aid the Watch with their enquiries, there are dragons to round up first.</p>
    <p>Rene, playing Surly, decides to try to round up some of the dragons while Cliff continues their conversation. The GM, Eleri, decides this calls for a test as the outcome is uncertain. </p>
    <p><strong>Eleri(GM):</strong> Ok Surly, what trait do you have that would make you good at dragon wrangling?</p>
    <p><strong>Rene:</strong> I’ve got Blends into the background. That should let me sneak up on them without being noticed.</p>
    <p><strong>Eleri(GM):</strong> Absolutely. I will say that while you blend into the background excellently on the street, the paints and pigments you’ve got will make it harder for you to sneak up on a dragon as they’re always sniffing for something flammable to eat. So take a d10 on that. I’m also going to say that any consequences are probably going to be minor for this test. </p>
    <p>Rene rolls a 5 on their outcome die and the GM rolls a 6 on the Narrativium die. </p>
    <p>The GM describes the scene. </p>
    <p><strong>Eleri(GM):</strong> Cliff is patiently talking through the events of the night with Rosie while a vaguely dwarf sized shape scuttles across the background.<br /><br /> Surly, you see a small dragon currently dragging a half eaten boot under a handcart. Slowly and carefully you approach from behind. As you get to just outside grabbing distance its head shoots up in panic. It cracks its head on the underside of the cart, and lets out a pained shriek and a small gout of flame. You hear some worrying sounds of indigestion. <br /><br />Does anyone want to help Surly? Remember that you’ll increase the consequences to major. </p>
    <p>Aisha, playing Hamrahan, decides to try and improve the situation. </p>
    <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> I've got the core trait Better it happen to me than you so I’d like to help by getting Surly out of the way of this upset dragon.</p>
    <p><strong>Eleri(GM):</strong> Sure that makes sense, you're trying to protect a fellow officer from a dangerous situation. You’ve definitely done this before and the trait and action both fit really well, have a d12. Spend one Luck for helping and give me a roll.</p>
    <p>Aisha rolls their outcome die. As this is a continuation of the same test the GM does not reroll the Narrativium die. </p>
    <p><strong>Aisha:</strong> Damn, I rolled a 6.</p>
    <p><strong>Eleri(GM):</strong> Right, that's a double, so it’s a tie. <br /><br />So Surly, you hear the dragon's stomach start to rumble ominously. You know that swamp dragons have notoriously sensitive stomachs and a tendency to become craters if startled. You stare in fascinated horror as the dragon's eyes start to cross and it hiccups ominously. Once, twice… silence… then your world spins wildly as Hamrahan tackles you to the ground a split second before the sturdy walls of the Sunshine Sanctuary are tested once again. The small dragon explodes, destroying the handcart, and showering you both with its contents, last nights mucking out. Hamrahan you managed to get Surly to safety and they are protected from the shower hitting the ground. Unfortunately, that protection is you. Gain the trait Covered in dragon faeces. </p>
    <p>Having already spent their Luck to help Surly, Aisha cannot also spend Luck to decrease the degree of the consequence of the test. They did at least succeed in what they set out to do and saved Surly from an exploding dragon. </p>
    <p>The scene continues as the party attempts to solve the mystery of the stolen dragons. </p>
