<h1 data-split-here="Characters and Traits ">Characters<br />and Traits </h1>
    <p>Characters in Adventures in Ankh-Morpork are a collection of traits held together in the approximate shape of a person. In this way they are not so different from their players. These traits are recorded on your character sheet and are how players use their PCs to interact with the world around them.  </p>
    <p>In the full game, you’ll spend time lovingly crafting elaborate backstories and slightly amusing names for your character. However, for this quickstart, we’ve provided pre-filled in character sheets to get you going with a minimum of fuss. </p>
    <p>Here’s a quick run through of the character sheet and what all these things mean:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Your character's Name(s) and Pronouns</li>
      <li>The group they belong to</li>
      <li>Their species and background</li>
      <li>Niche traits: their experiences and where they fit in their group</li>
      <li>Their core: their outlook, and how they react to the world</li>
      <li>Quirk traits, the odd little idiosyncrasies and eccentricities that make their character who they are</li>
      <li>A brief character description</li>
      <li>A place to note down any consequences you gain during play</li>
      <li> Notes, where you write notes</li>
      <li> Luck, a measure of what your character can get away with</li>
      <li> Character art, after all a picture says a thousand words</li>
    </ol>

    <p>All of these things are traits. These traits take the place of more traditional statistics and can be used in a test to argue the applicability of your actions. They tell you what a character is good at, as well as what they struggle with. They can be used to influence the world and story the characters find themselves in, while also providing information to help you play that character at the table. The only exception to this is Luck, which tracks your favour with The Lady and therefore how much you can get away with before things start catching up with you. </p>
    <p>Characters have access to everything a trait could encompass. Let’s take an example chosen completely at random and in no way related to this adventure whatsoever. A character who has the trait The Watch will have access to everything that entails. Official badge, shiny breastplate, one sword, short (or weapon appropriate to the species) and AM$38 a month plus allowances. The same is true of every trait; a troll is incredibly strong and smarter in cold weather, an iconographer has all the tools of the trade needed to keep those imps painting, and someone who remembers the good bad old days probably knows their way around a back alley or twelve (provided they haven’t been built on or otherwise closed down for the sake of Hygiene).  </p>
      
    <h2>Luck</h2>
    <p>Luck is a measure of your character's favour with The Lady *. It is spent in two ways: firstly to decrease the severity of a consequence and secondly to help another player with a test. Both of these cost one Luck, and only one Luck can be spent per test. It is up to the players whether they wish to take the safe option and tone down the consequences, or risk another roll and try to gain a success.    </p>
    <p>To regain Luck you’ll have to do things that pique The Lady’s interest. Excellent, unusual or downright weird roleplay, ideas and use of traits can all earn you back a point of Luck, at the GMs discretion. </p>
    <h3>Awarding Luck</h3>
    <p>The GM is the representative of The Lady at the table. As such the GM can award Luck to players for excellent roleplay, ridiculous plans, amazing, or awful, puns and outstanding bastardisation of the English language. This should be kept rare enough for players to feel like they’ve earned it rather than expect it every time.    </p>
    <aside>
      <hr>
    <p>A PC jumps out a second story window and argues that their trait Is eager to see more of the world should allow them to land without too much injury. They are eager to see the world, and the world is rushing up eagerly to meet them. The GM gives them a d10 and decides that such justification deserves some Luck. However, it’s not going to entirely negate the fact that they jumped out of a window without any precautions. They roll a 6 on the outcome die against an 8 on the Narrativium. The player uses their newfound Luck to reduce the consequence from At least one broken limb to Has thorns in uncomfortable places. Thus the Lady, intrigued by this wanton display of lack of forethought, ensures a soft(ish) landing for them in a previously unseen compost heap. </p>

    <h2>Traits in Tests </h2>
    <p>Everything on your character sheet is a trait; even your character’s name can be used as a trait if you think it'll justify your character being good at the test they’re attempting. Traits are not necessarily good or bad, but are situational. For example, having the trait I spend more time in the Drum than the Library would help you if you were trying to win a drinking contest or track down a specific unscrupulous person, but hinder you if you needed to do some occult research. </p>
    <p>The easiest way to think of it is “I have X trait, therefore I should be good at Y action”. However, one of the key aspects of Pratchett's work is wordplay. As such we not only expect but downright insist that players bend, twist, bludgeon, beat and otherwise wrangle their traits to fit scenarios they were never meant for and justify actions they should have little to no business being associated with. </p>
    <p>When justifying a trait for a test, the player should state why it will be useful for their action, then the GM decides the dice value. At the end of the day, deciding the exact die values for a particular test is much less important than rolling them.</p>

      <hr>
    <p>Hamrahan’s trait Always hits what he should be aiming at could be used to justify making a crack shot. Or it could be much more amusingly used to justify a lucky ricochet. Perhaps Hamrahan’s hand flies off his wrist while he’s gesticulating wildly and hits something he should have been concentrating on while he has an argument with Igorina about stitching. Both are completely valid uses of the trait. </p>

    <p><span class="footnote"> * </span> The Lady is one of the gods of the Disc, one of those feuding, grumbling, all too human entities who live on Dunmanifestin' playing games with lives. And dice. And sometimes snacks.</p></div>
    
    <h2>Consequences </h2>
    <p>The thing about actions is they have consequences. These will manifest in gameplay as a new trait for the PCs, a twist in the narrative, or both. These traits are temporary and only apply as long as they are relevant; some will go away on their own at the end of the scene, others will require the PC to spend time removing them.   </p>
    <p>There are several degrees of consequence: inconsequential, minor, major, and exceptional.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><dt>Inconsequential consequences</dt> are things which will cause a small inconvenience for the PC; getting a paper cut, being overcharged for a sausage-inna-bun or gaining the trait Has a "kick me" sign stuck on their back.</li>
      <li><dt>Minor consequences</dt> will cause an inconvenience for the PC; twisting an ankle, losing money at the races or gaining the trait Has a rumour going around.</li>
      <li><dt>Major consequences</dt> will cause problems for the PC and may affect those around them; calling the Librarian a monkey, losing Chrysoprase’s money at the races or gaining the trait Wanted by the Thieves’ Guild. </li>
      <li><dt>Exceptional consequences</dt> are threatening to life and livelihood and will cause the PC to be removed from the scene, and potentially the story. This should be a conversation between GM and Player as to how they wish to proceed. Some options can include a near Death experience, being wanted by the Patrician, a magical mishap or any other appropriately exceptional consequence that feels narratively appropriate.  </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A PC can spend a point of Luck during a test to decrease the degree of a consequence by one, unless another PC has attempted to help them in the test. </p>

      <hr><h3>Near Death Experience</h3>
    <p>Since there are no health points in this game, you may be asking how and if characters can die. This is generally handled through an exceptional consequence to a failed test. In the full game, there will be rules covering this, but we sincerely doubt anyone will be dying in the span of this adventure*. The GM is of course free to give someone a brush with Death if they really screw up a particular roll, providing they remember to <span style="font-variant:small-caps">talk like this.</span> </p></aside>
