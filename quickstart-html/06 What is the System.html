  Discworld is a unique setting, and it deserves a bespoke system to do it justice; a system that encourages those random silly moments that RPGs and the Discworld novels both embrace so well. A system that allows for flexibility and actively encourages puns, awful and amazing alike. In short, a system that makes you feel like you are IN Discworld. That is what we have created.*
</p>
<p>Our system is built on two core premises:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    The Disc has a story it wants to tell, and left alone will spin on much as it has always done.
  </li>
  <li>The players want to change this story to one more to their liking.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Discworld itself operates like a story, and top research wizards have found that it is helped along by an element found in abundance on Discworld: Narrativium.
</p>
<p>
  It is this Narrativium that the players are going to have to contend with if they want to forge their own story in a world frankly bursting at the seams with stories.
</p>
<p>
  Players will use their character and their dice to see if they have what it takes to beat the Narrativium into the shape they want. They need to be careful, however; sometimes it beats back.
