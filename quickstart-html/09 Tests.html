<h1 data-split-here="Tests">Tests</h1>
    <p>Whenever players try to do something in a scene that has a chance of failure, they  will need to make a test! No matter whether you are snooping around, in tense political negotiations or trying to outdrink a dwarf, all tests are resolved in the same way. </p>
    <h2>Attempting a Test</h2>
    <p>The test itself will follow the same steps every time: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Declare an action</li>
      <li>Justify the Action Using Traits </li>
      <li>GM Determines the Outcome Die</li>
      <li>Roll the Outcome Die Against the Narrativium Die</li>
      <li>Get Help (optional)</li>
      <li>Resolve the Test (not optional) </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Declare an Action</h3>
    <p>The player says what they want to do. If the GM thinks that they need to make a test in order to do so, then move on to the next step. </p>
    <h3>Justify the Action Using Traits </h3>
    <p>The player who declared the action decides which trait on their character’s sheet they’re using to justify the action. It is encouraged to twist the meanings of your traits and use them in absolutely ridiculous ways to justify actions they have no business justifying. </p>
    <h3>GM Determines the Outcome Die</h3>
    <p>The GM then determines the dice that will be used in the test out of the d4, d6, d10 and d12. If the justification is absolutely flawless, or this is very much within the PC’s wheelhouse, it’s a d12. If the PC clearly has no idea what they’re doing, and their attempt at justification is flimsy, it’s a d4. The d6 and the d10 come between these points, as determined by the GM. The GM also decides what the consequences for failing the test will be. </p>
    <h3>Roll the Outcome Die <br />Against the Narrativium Die</h3>
    <p>The player rolls the outcome die the GM decided was appropriate. The GM then rolls the Narrativium die (the d8). Once the dice are rolled the results are compared. If the outcome die has rolled higher, the PC has been successful. If the Narrativium die is higher, then the PC has failed, and may now be subject to unforeseen consequences or twists represented as new traits.</p>
    <p>If the dice have the same result then it’s a tie. The PC achieves what they set out to do, but they also suffer consequences as a new trait, twist or both. </p>
    <h3>Get Help </h3>
    <p>If the test is a failure then one PC in the scene can spend 1 Luck to try and help. This is risky, however, since this will also make the consequence for failing the test one degree worse, and open themselves up to the consequences of the test alongside the original test taker. If they still want to help they spend one point of Luck and then they repeat the first two steps (explain how they’re helping, and their justification for doing so), and roll the outcome die the GM decides is appropriate. Their outcome die replaces the original outcome die. If the test is still a failure or a tie, then both PCs suffer the now much worse consequences! </p>
    <p>The GM does not reroll the Narrativium die when another PC decides to help, but the GM can at any point during the test decide to reroll the Narrativium die using an NPC’s trait as justification. This second result replaces the first result. The GM can only do this once per test. </p>
    <h3>Resolve the Test </h3>
    <p>After the dice are rolled, the GM narrates the outcome, whether it was a glorious success, a surprising stalemate or an embarrassing tumble into the Ankh. They also describe how the PC(s) suffer any consequences (p.18) for failing the test. If no player tried to help during the test, then the player suffering consequences can spend 1 Luck to reduce the severity of the consequence they suffer by one degree. </p>

        <p>Constable Surly Underhand is trying to get some information from a Shades informant while in uniform. The action is something fairly simple for him; he has the trait A dwarf born and raised in the Shades so he has contacts, and it's not unusual. He is in uniform, however, so what could have been a d12 if he was in plainclothes becomes a d10.</p>

    <h2>Group Tests</h2>
    <p>There are two situations in which a group test is more appropriate than individual tests. The first is when everyone wants the same outcome, but only one success is necessary to achieve it, for instance when people are trying to gain information about the same thing from different sources. The second is when everyone wants the same outcome and one failure will stop them all from achieving it, e.g. when the whole party is trying to move around without being spotted. </p>
    <p>For both instances, as with other tests, the players state their action and traits and the GM decides what die they roll (it's perfectly normal for different players to be rolling different types of die in a group test). All players then roll. The GM only rolls the Narrativium die once, and compares each player’s outcome die to that Narrativium die roll. Then the GM narrates each result. </p>
    <p>For those tests where everyone wants the same outcome, and only one success is necessary, the outcome die that rolls the highest has the most advantageous outcome, for example the most pertinent clue. All other results add their own flavour and support, if successful, or if a failure, they undermine the most successful outcome. If the Narrativium die has the highest result the players all suffer consequences, for example gaining incorrect information.</p>
    <p>For tests when everyone wants the same outcome and one failure will stop them achieving it, the outcome die that rolls the lowest is counted as the result of the test. </p>
    <p>Any PC that is involved in a group test may not help another PC on that test, but if any PC is not involved in the group test they may help as normal.  </p>

    <h3>Combat </h3>
    <p>As previously stated, there are no special rules for combat. If a fight does break out it is treated the same as any other test, with a slight focusing of the Narrativium die to represent the opposing force in the conflict rather than the world or story in general. </p>

    <h2>Million to One </h2>
    <p>Sometimes your players will surprise the GM with an absolutely absurd, ridiculous or genius plan that is so outlandishly unlikely it makes you stop and go “it’s a million to one chance, but it just might work.” In these situations the GM can rule that the PCs automatically succeed on their plan. These auto successes should be very few and far between. Remember that any attempt to force a million to one chance is doomed to failure.</p>
