<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>Before you invite your players to pick a character, things will go a lot smoother if you have read the rules in the first section of this book and taken a quick look at this adventure. You don’t need to read everything, but a general overview of how the game works and what shape the story might take will help to keep things running smoothly. If you only read one thing in advance, read the @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#adventure-overview]{Adventure Overview}.</p>
<p>Once you have a handle on things, you gather your players and present them with the available characters. Each player picks the character they want to play and introduces themselves to the group.</p>
<p>Next, read the read-aloud text in the @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#lady-ramkins-sunshine-sanctuary-for-sick-dragons]{Lady Ramkin's Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons} entry to set the scene and you are ready to go!</p>
<h2>Adventure Overview</h2>
<p>The players take on the roles of members of the Watch, Ankh-Morpork’s police. The team has been asked to investigate a break-in at Lady Ramkin’s Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons. As they investigate this crime, they will start to uncover what has happened by following clues and investigating some @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#key-locations]{Key Locations} within the city. If your group decides to go somewhere different and you feel comfortable improvising that location, we encourage you to do so!</p>
<p>The clues all eventually lead to the @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#misbegot-bridge]{Misbegot Bridge} where the culprit is preparing the last stage of their plan. Your players will hopefully rush in and save the day, or at least fail in a way that will make a good headline for the Times.</p>
<h2>What’s Going on?</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, the architects of @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#stone-on-stone]{Stone on Stone} were hired to inspect Misbegot Bridge. They sent a surveyor by the name of John Johnson, a man filled with hatred of golemkind and his employers. John hatched a plan, and spent the last few weeks in the @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#lamp-and-needles]{Lamp and Needles} working out a way to steal enough dragons to blow a hole in the bridge. Once he was ready, he stole into @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#knobblers-and-sons]{Knobblers and Sons} to hijack the coal delivery carriage. With this, he broke into the @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#lady-ramkins-sunshine-sanctuary-for-sick-dragons]{Sunshine Sanctuary} and stole a dozen or so highly volatile dragons. He took them back to his rooms at @UUID[Compendium.discworld-modiphius.discworld-quickstart.JournalEntry.JOVzNNarUUTcC016.JournalEntryPage.9cRZ1If93j4xSQ2w#mrs.-ethins-boarding-house]{Mrs. Ethin's Boarding House} to wait until nightfall and sneak under Misbegot Bridge. If he is not stopped, he will set the dragons off and complete his scheme.</p>

<h2>Motive</h2>
<p>Most of the adventure follows the party as they discover the how of John’s plan, but the why is equally important, especially for the finale.</p>
<p>John dislikes Ankh-Morpork’s rising reliance on golems and non-human workers, reasoning that a man’s ability to work is what separates him from non-Librarian apes. He has recently lost his own job to the golem Plotz, which was the final straw. He has decided to visit his anger on the city at large, while ruining the reputation of the company that fired him.</p>

<h1>Key Locations</h1>
<p>Throughout the adventure, the PCs may investigate some or all of the locations below, starting at the Sunshine Sanctuary in the Scours. The Ankh is a large and slow moving river that splits the great city of Ankh-Morpork in half. This adventure contains locations in the Scours on the east bank and Dimwell on the west bank.</p>
<p>When PCs want to go to a location, simply turn to the corresponding page. If a PC is crossing from the Scours to Dimwell or vice versa, they will have to cross Misbegot Bridge.</p>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <p>While running this adventure, it’s useful to keep the following tips in mind:</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Consequences</strong>: The main core of the adventure is finding out “who dunnit” and what they’re going to dun next. As such, the potential consequences for failed tests should be things that are important. NPCs forgetting information, the loss of precious time or the destruction of useful clues are all consequences that impact a character more than physical harm. We have provided some example consequences for failed tests on each page to provide inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Clues</strong>: On each location we have provided a description of “What happened here?”. These descriptions give you a quick overview of John’s actions in that location, and allow you to extrapolate clues from the past. We have also provided some example clues that might be there. You may use as many or as few of these as you like, and should use your own common sense to determine what the PCs find depending on their actions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Random Events</strong>: On [Misbegot Bridge] you will find a list of random events you can use to spice up travel or a scene. You may decide to roll on this table whenever the party crosses the bridge, in the middle of any other scene or simply use them for inspiration.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Own up to mistakes</strong>: Sometimes you will say something that doesn’t make sense, or leads players to the wrong conclusion. Most of the time this isn’t a problem; the world can be a little messy and players will surprise you with their corkscrew logic at the best of times. Sometimes, however, you will say something that makes absolutely no sense and send the players on a complete tangent. In these cases it's easiest to put up your hand and say “Ah, yes, actually the footprints do lead up and down the path, sorry about that.”
  </p>

  <h1>Lady Ramkin’s Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>John Johnson broke in last night by using a key and carriage he stole from Knobblers and Sons. While he was there, he let all the dragons free to cover how many he had stolen.</p>
</aside>
<p>
  <strong>Read Aloud</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You’ve been ordered to head to the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons to investigate a break in. Your orders were given to you personally by the Commander of the City Watch himself, Sir Samuel Vimes. You remember his words well. He was particularly clear that all three points were equally important.</em>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <em>Find out what happened.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Protect the people of Ankh-Morpork.</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Don’t cause more paperwork than necessary.</em>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  <em>He also mentioned that if you need help during your investigation, you should talk to Sergeant Angua. She’s taking her day off in the Bucket over on Gleam Street, so don’t expect her to be happy about it.</em>
</p>
<p>
  <em>You find yourselves standing on the neat cobbles of Morphic Street, blinking in the morning sun. The wrought iron gates before you bear the words “Here Be Dragons.” If that wasn’t enough of a clue that you were in the right place, a papier-mâché statue of a dragon with a slot in its forehead sits to the right of the gate. It appears to be holding a bedraggled sign that reads “Don’t Let My Flame Go Out.”</em>

    <span style="font-family: &#x27;Libre Caslon Text&#x27;">
      <em>*Which read “Adopt a Dragon today!” and “The Ankh-Morpork Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons”, in case anyone was still unsure.</em>
    </span>
  </p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Hungover Dragon</strong>: A Golden Deceiver (a good watch-dragon) called Ruffly is unconscious on the grounds just inside the gate. He was fed a bottle of Bearhugger’s whiskey stolen from the Lamp and Needles. Whoever did this knew that Ruffly was a loud dragon and took steps to pacify him.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Copy of the Times</strong>: A discarded newspaper. There is an article on the Alchemists' Guild exploding, a story on a freak downpour of rain that will be happening around noon and a thinkpiece on the charitable efforts of the Golem Trust. None of these stories are directly related.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Wheel ruts</strong>: Wheel ruts outside the loading bay of the Sanctuary are fresh, suggesting a carriage was here last night. The carriage that was here was from Knobbler And Sons.
  </p>
  <h2>Morphic Street, the Scours</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Quiet morning, respectable houses, faint smell of the Ankh</em>
  </p>
  <p>This street is home to the Sunshine Sanctuary which has a large and sturdy gate and very thick walls, the kind that are designed to reassure the rest of the neighbourhood. Next to the gate, nestled in further signs* is a bellpull that will draw the attention of Rosie Devant-Molei from within. The only other business of note is the Lamp and Needles. Most other businesses moved away after finding out that “acts of dragon” are not covered by inn-sewer-ants.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>Mysterious Admirer: The head dragon keeper, Rosie Devant-Molei, has been the recipient of attempted wooing by a man who would approach her in the Lamp and Needles over the last two weeks. The man was John, and he asked her a lot of questions about dragons.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Empty Coal Barrels</strong>: A coal dust delivery was missed this morning. Usually it is delivered by the proprietor of Knobblers and Sons over on Wharfinger street.a
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sacharissa</strong>: A reporter from the Times was snooping around the Sanctuary this morning, Rosie had to turn her away until she could get a handle on the dragon problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Keys</strong>
    : The only people with keys to the Sanctuary are Lady Sybil Vimes (out of the city on business), Rosie and the proprietor of <br>Knobblers and Sons.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Scrap</strong>: A scrap of brown cloth can be found in a dragon’s mouth, it came from John’s trouser leg.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Menu</strong>: A faded menu from the Lamp and Needles has been pinned to the wall. Rosie often visits the tavern.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Articles</strong>: A framed wall of articles about the Sanctuary. Rosie can inform players that she was in talks with Sacharissa to perhaps start a dragon-based supplement to the Times, she was thinking of calling it “A monthly guide to swamp dragons, that most wonderful of creatures, and also stories and inspirational anecdotes regarding them.”
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Distrust</strong>: The Watch make a fool of themselves in front of Rosie Devant-Molei, making her reach out to the Times in order to find her dragons.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Soot</strong>: An exploding dragon gives a PC the trait Covered in Soot.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Doe-eyed Explosive</strong>: A random dragon takes a liking to a PC, following them. The dragon will explode if it is ever more than 10ft from the PC.
  </p>
  <h2>Sunshine Sanctuary, Interior</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Sulphuric whiff, sooty residue, optimistic slogans</em>
  </p>
  <p>The interior of the Sanctuary is in pandemonium, with the last of the Dragons being wrangled into their cages by Rosie Devant-Molei with the help of a few interchangeable Emmas.* Once the dragons have been calmed down and corralled into their pens it will become clear that a dozen of them are Missing.</p>
  <p>
    <em>* Well bred young ladies who seem genuinely excited about shovelling dragon muck.</em>
  </p>
  <h2>Dragons</h2>
  <p>Generally around 2 feet long. A female dragon is called a hen, while a male dragon is called a pewmet (up to eight months), a cock (fourteen months), a snood (to two years) and then a cobb (to death). A dead swamp dragon is known as a crater. You can roll two d4s on the table to create a random dragon and determine what it is doing.</p>
  <img src="https://files.d20.io/images/432567670/uVWeSu3smYX0Rs4V1MlU0g/max.png?1741816751">
  <h2>Missing</h2>
  <p>A dozen dragons is enough to make anyone nervous, but what makes it worse is that one of them is Gunter. Gunter is a particularly fine example of a Pixy-faced Smut, a breed that requires extra care and attention from its owner. If Gunter does not receive his nutritional additives within exactly 8 hours** he will explode. Rosie Devant-Molei will insist the PCs take a dose with them.</p>
  <p>
    <em>** This is technically against the laws of narrative causality that determine this sort of looming threat should have exactly 24 hours.</em>

  <h1>Lamp and Needles</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>John Johnson has spent his evenings here over the last few weeks gathering information on the Sanctuary and planning his upcoming crimes.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Missing Patron</strong>: Cripus Knobbler of Knobblers and Sons wasn’t in last night, which is strange. He usually drops in for a quiet pint after his coal delivery at the sanctuary.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Sacharissa</strong>: Marla is particularly proud of the fact that her tavern is going to be featured in the Times for being in the top eighteen most crooked medium-sized taverns in Ankh-Morpork. The reporter was over this morning and asked a lot of questions about the Sanctuary.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mrs. Ethin</strong>: John was struggling to pay for drinks (see Theodolite below), Marla remembers him complaining about owing Mrs. Ethin his last dollar. Unknown to her, Mrs. Ethin's Boarding House is where John has been staying.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Warning signs</strong>: After a few too many drinks on a night when he wasn’t talking to Rosie about dragons, John spent half the night bending Rufus’ ear about the unfairness of the world. All Rufus remembers for certain is that he said “I’m going to use a dragon, a dragon will solve everything.” Rufus didn’t understand the metaphor, but was happy enough when John left.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Theodolite</strong>: Rufus has a strange brass device that seems halfway between a telescope and a pocket watch. John Johnson paid for his last round of drinks with the device; etched on the inside of the brass workings are the words “Stone on Stone”.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dimwell</strong>: Rufus is proud that John came over for the ‘best pint in Ankh-Morpork’, since he lives all the way over in Dimwell.
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Thrown out</strong>: Rufus throws the party out of their bar for causing a ruckus, and does not allow them back in.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tipsy</strong>: An offered drink gives a PC the trait Tired and Emotional.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Misunderstanding</strong>: Marla mishears something the PC said, and gives them false information.
  </p>
  <h2>Morphic Street, the Scours</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Quiet and peaceful, respectable houses, faint smell of the Ankh</em>
  </p>
  <p>The front of the Lamp and Needles leans dangerously out into the street. This is allowed because it is historic. Exactly what history it has is unclear. It is closed in the morning, but enough banging on the door will awake Rufus and Marla.</p>
  <h2>Lamp and Needles, Interior</h2>
  <p>
    <em>A forced cosiness, trinkets on every wall, the scent of musty velvet</em>
  </p>
  <p>Run by Rufus and Marla, the Lamp and Needles is host to many a well-behaved reveller, as long as their revelling is done at a respectable volume. A variety of armchairs threaten to swallow any who sit in them, and in the evening the place is filled with a low murmur of quiet people having an excellent time.</p>
  <img src="https://files.d20.io/images/432567648/-s6FEKz3q5XGMzppqceNhA/max.png?1741816740" alt="">
  <h3>Rufus and Marla</h3>
  <p>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Tavern Owners (He & She)</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <em>Compassionate bickerers</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Hard of hearing and, more often, understanding</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>Open minded but old fashioned</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The pair of elderly publicans who own the Lamp and Needles can answer questions about Rosie Devant-Molei, Cripus Knobbler, and John Johnson, all of whom have been in the tavern over the last week. Unfortunately, the couple’s hearing isn’t what it used to be, leading to any question spoken at a reasonable volume being misinterpreted with amusing results.</p>
  <h1>The Times and the Bucket</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>Many things, but none directly involving the theft of the dragons. This location is a good place for PCs to go to if they are looking for a new lead, or want to get more information about a specific clue.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Missing Knobbler</strong>: Sacharissa has already been to Knobblers and Sons while investigating the story but it seems they weren’t open.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fire!</strong> Sacharissa has to cut the chat short, as she has to go report on a fire over in Dimwell. Unbeknownst to her, this is Mrs Ethin's Boarding House.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Have you seen this man?</strong> A call for persons matching John’s identity can be put in the paper about to go out. At the end of the next scene the group will get reports about the man working for Stone on Stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Otto’s Iconograph</strong>: The Times’ iconographer took a picture of the scene of the crime this morning. He would be happy to share a copy with a connoisseur. The picture reveals one of the clues available in the Sunshine Sanctuary for Dragons.
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Scandal</strong>: The PC realises they have told the Times more than they should have, and that tomorrow’s copy will be very interesting.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Interview</strong>: Sacharissa refuses to help the Watch with their questions unless they agree to an interview.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Red Herring</strong>: Sacharissa wonders if the dragon-thief was a member of the Draconic Liberation Front, a group that used to meet in the Lamp and Needles. They were misguided, and ultimately disbanded several years ago after they learned exactly what a dragon can do to an untrained protestor.
  </p>
  <h2>Gleam Street, the Scours</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Narrow and winding, newspaper salesman, uneven cobbles, a faint acrid smell</em>
  </p>
  <p>Home to two fine institutions, the Times, purveyor of truth and knowledge, and the Bucket, chosen bar of the Watch.</p>
  <h2>The Times</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Running machinery, an acrid chemical scent, dwarfs being industrious, very vocal editing</em>
  </p>
  <p>The Times is Ankh-Morpork’s premier source of news. Watchmen are generally not allowed to come in unless they are bearing a story, so the group will need to convince Gunilla Goodmountain they are worth letting in. Once inside, Sacharissa Cripslock can be found at her (well used) typewriter and Otto Chriek can be found down in the dark room.</p>
  <h2>The Bucket</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Off-duty Watchmen, an absence of charm and ambience, the smell of stale beer</em>
  </p>
  <p>The unofficial bar of the Watch. Not a place for causing trouble. If the officers in the Bucket are forced to ply their trade, they will do so with extreme prejudice. If visited during the day, the place is half empty, if visited during the evening it is half full. Either way Sergeant Angua can be found spending her free day here, reading a book and not wanting to be disturbed.</p>

  <h1>Misbegot Bridge</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>John Johnson has hidden his stolen carriage full of dragons under the bridge, and plans to blow the whole thing up.</p>
  <h2>Misbegot Bridge, Top</h2>
  <p>Sturdy and lined with houses, rickety scaffolding, whimsically arched</p>
  <p>If a player is playing as Constable Misbegot & Ampersands (the gargoyle), a particularly crooked building at the western end of the bridge is their home. Each time the group crosses the bridge, a Random Event is happening here. Only if the group take the Goods Lift or scramble down the scaffolding will they discover what is happening Under the Bridge.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>From above, there are no obvious clues as to John Johnson’s plan, though scaffolding along the buildings does show construction work taking place.</p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Lost time</strong>: With only 8 hours to find the dragons, every wasted minute counts! The party loses too much time getting sidetracked, advancing the time by a narratively exciting margin. This should be tracked fairly loosely, but around two hours is a good benchmark for how much time is lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Foul Ole Ron</strong>: A man whose smell introduces him, sometimes from across international borders. The beggar mumbles something at the party, and anyone who interacts with him will gain the trait Lingering smell. If the party have crossed the bridge a few times, Ron might complain in his hard-to-understand way about the “gentrification” project going on under the bridge.
  </p>
  <h3>Random Events</h3>
  <p>The events may not directly lead to clues or information, but make the city feel alive. Each time the party crosses the bridge, you may want to incorporate the events that took place on previous crossings, as well as adding a new one!</p>
  <h3>Goods Lift</h3>
  <p>The construction site slung Under the Bridge is supplied by a heavy goods lift. It was sabotaged by John Johnson after he used it to stash the carriage. Fixing the lift requires a mixture of brute force and mechanical cunning, and is nigh-on impossible to achieve without making a large amount of noise.</p>

  <h2>Under the Bridge</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Piles of bricks, the smell of masonry dust, rickety scaffolding, murky twilight</em>
  </p>
  <p>Slung under the bridge is a network of scaffolding that bears building materials, tools and a carriage with “Knobblers and Sons” written on the side. At the other side of the vertigo-inducing walkway is John Johnson, completing the last stage of his plan. He is currently trying to light a long fuse with a rather uncooperative dragon, Gunter. The fuse leads across the scaffolding toward where the carriage of dragons wobbles dangerously. If John notices the party he will flee, triggering the [Finale].</p>

  <h3>Wrap Up</h3>
  <p>Once the excitement is over and the culprit either caught or at large, it’s time to wrap things up. To end the adventure, provide a little round up of the consequences of their actions, and give each player a chance to give a little epilogue for their character. Perhaps a player wants to know what happened to Cripus’ coal shop, or made a promise of an interview to Sacharissa. Now is a good time to gently explore these loose threads as the game winds to a close. When everyone is happy and the session has naturally ended, you can close this book and have a nice cup of tea.*</p>

  <h1>Knobblers and Sons</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>John Johnson broke in last night then silenced the owner of the shop and stole his carriage. Since then, Cripus Knobbler has held onto a version of life through sheer passion for his work, becoming a zombie.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Drinking Buddies</strong>: Cripus would go to the Lamp and Needles after delivering coal dust to the Sanctuary, and he remembers seeing John there on more than one occasion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>A Proper Obituary</strong>: Cripus wonders if he could get a proper obituary into the Times, the publicity would do his store no end of good.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Rant</strong>: The intruder went on a rant about golems, ending it with “They can draw the plans, lay the stone on stone then leave houses empty while the rest of us are thrown out onto the streets they built.”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Dimmers Tattoo</strong>: Cripus saw a tattoo on the man’s forearm that read “Dimmers IV ever”, the Dimmers are a football team from Dimwell, so he was most likely local.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Inky Sleeve</strong>: John Johnson left his brown jacket behind when he stole Cripus’ uniform. The jacket has ink on its sleeve, suggesting the owner spent time behind a desk.
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Self Pity</strong>: Cripus is overwhelmed by his recent death, and refuses to answer any more questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Curiosity</strong>: Sierra decides to follow the party, and will be put in mortal danger during the Finale.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Red Herring</strong>: John Johnson left behind a beermat from the Bucket with the word “Vetinari” written on it. This has no bearing on the case, it was used as part of a game of twenty questions.

  <h2>Wharfinger Street, Dimwell</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Bustling carriages, busy commerce, the smell of varied meats</em>
  </p>
  <p>The outside of Knobblers and Sons is a neat little shop front with fancy brass lettering. The front door is locked, despite all other businesses being open. Sierra is here, complaining that the coal shop should be open by now. To the back of the shop is a small courtyard with wheel ruts showing that a carriage used to sit here. The back door to the shop has been forced open with a crowbar.</p>
  <h2>Knobblers and Sons</h2>
  <p>
    <em>A coppery smell mixed with coal, cleaned surfaces, barrels of coal</em>
  </p>
  <p>The interior of the shop is filled with brass buckets of artisan’s coal, the kind of perfectly shaped lumps that would look perfect on a Hogswatch postcard next to a roaring flame. In the upstairs room is Cripus Knobbler who has been tied and gagged, as well as Murdered.</p>
  <h3>Murdered</h3>
  <p>Those that die are usually lucky enough to pass onto the next life, but there are those with unfinished business personal enough to cling onto a life after the messy business of death. Cripus Knobbler is a passionate coal sculptor, and that passion has raised him as a zombie. He is confused, but more talkative than one might expect.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>Once freed and informed of his own murder, Cripus Knobbler will be happy to tell the Watch what he knows, especially if they want to know anything about the black arts. Coal sculpting is a transitory art, and most people are woefully ignorant or underwhelmed by it. When Cripus took over the shop from his father* he decided that the artisanal coal market was ripe for the taking. Surprisingly it has been rather popular, mostly with young trolls looking for a trendy snack.</p>

  <h1>Mrs. Ethin's Boarding House</h1>
  <h3>What Happened Here?</h3>
  <p>John Johnson brought a carriage full of dragons here last night, then took them onward to the [Misbegot Bridge]. During the night, one of the dragons escaped and caused a fire.</p>
  <h3>Clues</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Payslip</strong>: A surviving scrap of paper details John’s pay from his employer, Stone on Stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Singed Diary</strong>: John’s journal does not directly describe his plans, but is filled with rants decrying the use of golems.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Drawing plans</strong>: A tube designed for holding large drawings, it holds architectural plans for a bridge of some kind. Studying the map may reveal it is Misbegot Bridge.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cause of the Fire</strong>: A rather guilty looking dragon is hiding in a wardrobe. A tag on her collar says “My name is Smoky, if found, please return to the Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons. Please do not feed me under any circumstances.”* Smoky escaped her captor and started this fire out of nervousness before finding her hiding space. If calmed down she can lead the PCs to Misbegot Bridge.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Boom!</strong>:.A nearby explosion shakes the ground as a wall of the boarding house collapses. A dragon had burrowed below the wall and nervously exploded.
  </p>
  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Burns</strong>: The raging flames singe clothing and hair. A PC gains the trait Nasty burns.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Ire</strong>: Mrs. Ethin blames the Watch for failing to protect her business, and demands compensation. If she is not mollified, a rumour will spread that the Watch burned down the Boarding House.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Collapse</strong>: The old building collapses, covering the area in dust and trapping a PC beneath rubble.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>* It’s quite a large tag.</em>

  <h2>Noontender Way, Dimwell</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Uneven cobbles, the smell of smoke, gawping crowds</em>
  </p>
  <p>The first thing anyone would notice about this street is a crowd of people that have gathered to watch Mrs. Ethin’s Boarding House. A column of smoke is erupting from the third floor of the ramshackle building, and a line of golems are piling up a small pile of Burning Possessions in the street.</p>
  <h3>Burning Possessions</h3>
  <p>A golem’s way of putting out a fire is to simply remove the burning items from the offending building, place them in the street, then stamp the flames out. The possessions in this case consist mostly of John’s clothes, books, and smouldering furniture. A red-faced Mrs. Ethin is looking for someone to blame.</p>

  <p>

  </p>
  <p>

    <em>*Repeat business is hard to come by in construction, so the Alchemists’ Guild is seen as something of a golden goose.</em>

  <h2>Waxwick Terrace, Dimwell</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Red brick buildings, neat brass plaques, air of respectability marred by the smell of the Ankh</em>
  </p>
  <p>The businesses along this lane are the kind that do not require much advertising. They are the kinds of businesses that connect the rich and mighty with people that actually do work. Among these businesses is Stone on Stone, identical to its neighbours in all ways except a polite little plaque marking it out.</p>

  <h2>Stone on Stone, Interior</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Writing desks, the faint scritching of quills, the smell of quiet opulence</em>
  </p>
  <p>The architect’s offices of Erika Lofte are staffed by industrious draftsmen, draftsdwarfs and even a draftgolem, Plotz. The business is on the ropes since the Alchemists’ Guild* changed suppliers. They currently have their hands full with the renovation of Misbegot Bridge, and can’t afford the contract to fail.</p>

  <p>A free golem hired out by the Golem Trust, Plotz is introspective and very literal. As a golem it has no sense of art, but if asked to draw something it can do so with complete and utter realism. Unlike an imp, which draws what it can see now, Plotz draws exactly what will be there when the job is finished. It has caused problems before by drawing mistakes the builders will make during construction and including upcoming graffiti daubed on the walls.</p>
