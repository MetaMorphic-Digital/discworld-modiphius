<p>
  Before we get into the rules themselves, it's worth taking a step back and asking: what is a roleplaying game (RPG)? As the name suggests, it's a game where you play a role. Each player takes on the role of a character within a world, in this case within Discworld, and via that character tells a story with their friends.

  Most roleplaying games, including this one, have two types of person at the table. Most people are players, and one is the gamemaster. Players take on the role of characters (inventively named player characters, or PCs). The gamemaster (GM) takes on the role of the world. They play the part of every other character in the game, all the non-player characters (NPCs) that the PCs talk to, walk past, interact with and ignore, as well as the world itself. They are the narrator of the PC’s actions and the world's reactions, the one who decides what happens next. The dangler of plot hooks, the doer of silly voices, the twister of the narrative and the conduit through which the story unfolds.

  It's important to note that while the GM may have a better idea of what is happening than the players, RPGs are collaborative storytelling experiences. Everyone influences and directs the story through their characters’ actions. The GM listens to their players, hones in on which aspects of the world and story they are enjoying and gives them more of that, but it's not their story alone.

  The core of an RPG is telling a story around a table, be it physical or digital, with your friends. So gather a group of like-minded people and enjoy the ridiculous, and often emotional, ride that is a great game.

  The GM is the person at the table that, supposedly, knows more about what’s going on than anyone else. They are the one with a better idea of where the story could be headed. Could. The story could be headed where they think but no plan survives contact with the players. Players will constantly twist and change a narrative until it is unrecognisable from its original form and the GM has to do some quite severe mental acrobatics to figure out how they got from point A to point 3.2 to Venezuela.

  Something the GM does have more control over, to a point, is the tone. This is something to be discussed with your players before your game. Some groups will want to embrace the silly and outlandish aspects of Discworld. Others may want to dive into the political intrigue surrounding the governance of Ankh-Morpork, and yet more may want something that’s made to showcase the world they know and love.
</p>
<p>
  Bear in mind that Discworld is a satirical setting, not a comedy one. Outside of the Fools’ Guild there are very few characters that are intentionally trying to be funny, and inside the Fools’ Guild there are very few characters that succeed at being funny. The funniest moments in Discworld novels come from excellent wordplay, and characters taking the events around them seriously no matter how ridiculous things are on the face of it.
