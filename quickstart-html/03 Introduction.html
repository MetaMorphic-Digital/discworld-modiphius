    <h2>What Is Discworld?</h2>
    <blockquote cite=" The Colour of Magic">“In a distant and second-hand set of dimensions, in an astral plane that was never meant to fly, the curling star-mists waver and part…
    <p>See…
    <p>Great A’Tuin the Turtle comes, swimming slowly through the interstellar gulf, hydrogen frost on his ponderous limbs, his huge and ancient shell pocked with meteor craters. Through sea-sized eyes that are crusted with rheum and asteroid dust He stares fixedly at the Destination.</p>
    <p>In a brain bigger than a city, with geological slowness, He thinks only of the Weight.</p>
    <p>Most of the weight is of course accounted for by Berilia, Tubul, Great T’Phon and Jerakeen, the four giant elephants upon whose broad and star-tanned shoulders the disc of the World rests, garlanded by the long waterfall at its vast circumference and domed by the baby-blue vault of Heaven.” </p></blockquote>
     
    <p>Discworld is the setting for the novels penned, or at least typed, by Sir Terry Pratchett. These novels are present on nearly every fantasy reader's shelf, and many a charity shop one as well. It is a world built on stories, with fuzzy geography and unreliable chronology. It's a place where characters try to live their day-to-day lives, but are forever interrupted by the needs of a narrative. A place where dwarfs look askance at trolls, vampires look askance at werewolves, and the citizens of Ankh-Morpork mostly just want to get through one single day without being looked askance at.    </p>
    <p>Discworld is a setting “where the gods play games with the lives of men, on a board which is at one and the same time a simple playing area and the whole world”, to quote Interesting Times. </p>
    <p>While you may not be gods, <strong><em>Adventures in Ankh-Morpork</em></strong> certainly allows you to play games with the lives of humans, dwarfs, trolls, gargoyles, Igors, zombies, and a whole plethora of other weird and wonderful creatures that call the Disc home. Well, maybe not the whole Disc, but certainly that stinking part of it that slumps on the Sto Plains known as Ankh-Morpork.  </p>
    <p>Discworld is a setting that has a special place in many hearts and imaginations all over  Roundworld. It is our unbelievable privilege to bring that world to life on tabletops, both physical and virtual, for fans old and new. We hope we’ve done it justice.  </p>
