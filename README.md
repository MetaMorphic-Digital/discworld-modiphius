## Trait Sheet

![Trait Sheet](assets/readme/trait-sheet.webp)

Change the Name of the Trait, its Category, its Severity (if Category is "Consequences"), and add an optional Description.

**Note:** It is the Trait's Name which displays on the Character Sheet. To see the Description, simply edit the Trait.

## Roll Trait Dialog

![Roll Trait Dialog](assets/readme/roll-trait-dialog.webp)

Click on a Trait to open the above dialog. Simply click the appropriate die icon to roll either a d4, d6, d10, or d12.

## Roll Card

Rolling a Trait will produce a roll card to the chat. The roll card displays the Trait's name, the character who rolled, and the results of the roll.

Depending on the result, another player can Help the character who rolled by clicking the "Help" button. This will open the Character Sheet in **Help Mode**, awaiting a Trait roll. Once rolled, the Help Trait and its result will appear on the original roll card.

## Up In Smoke (Adventure)

This short adventure serves as both a delightful introduction to the setting of Ankh-Morpork and a guide for the GM and players to learn the rules of the narrative-focused Discworld system:

> The players, a team of Ankh-Morpork's finest Watch members, are called to investigate a robbery at _Lady Ramkin's Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Dragons_. The mystery will bring the party to and fro across the city; will they be able to crack the case 'ere it grows claws?
