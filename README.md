## Trait Sheet

Change the Name of the Trait, its Category, its Severity (if Category is "Consequences"), and add an optional Description.

**Note:** It is the Trait's Name which displays on the Character Sheet. To see the Description, simply edit the Trait.

## Roll Trait Dialog

Click on a Trait to open the above dialog. Simply click the appropriate die icon to roll either a d4, d6, d10, or d12.

## Roll Card

Rolling a Trait will produce a roll card to the chat. The roll card displays the Trait's name, the character who rolled, and the results of the roll.

Depending on the result, another player can Help the character who rolled by clicking the "Help" button. This will open the Character Sheet in **Help Mode**, awaiting a Trait roll. Once rolled, the Help Trait and its result will appear on the original roll card.
